## Introduction
<div>
<img src="/img/pfp.jpg" alt="Profile photo" width=150 height=150 />
<p>I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC (the São Paulo State Technological College) - Prof. Jessen Vidal. I have already participated in a scientific initiation that lasted one year. Additionally, I have pursued further education through courses in data science and MongoDB, and I am currently honing my skills in web development through a comprehensive course.</p>
  <p>With a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I am now seeking opportunities to apply my skills in roles such as product ownership or UI/UX design. I am particularly drawn to these positions because of my passion for user-centered designs and product strategy, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects that prioritize user experience and functionality.</p>

## Education
<p align="justify">
In 2018 I graduated from high school at Elo Educacional school, where I had my first contact with programming, although it was very brief in just a few physics classes.
</p>
<p align="justify">
After graduating in 2018, I took the entrance exam for two years, joining Fatec in the second half of 2020. My goal was to learn about the world of programming, something that I had practically no knowledge about. The first semesters represented a new experience for me, considering that my knowledge about programming was zero. In addition there were technologies and programming languages that I had never seen before, in addition to the "IPL (Integrated Project Learning) project model", in which every semester we formed groups to work on an application to solve real customer problems (Companies associated with Fatec). These agile projects helped me develop both my soft skills and hard skills, and use in practice the means of organizing group projects used in the IT field.
